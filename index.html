		<h1>Data Design 'stab' at Medium.com</h1>
		</header>
		<h3>What this page tries to explain.</h3>
		<p>In my initial go around with data design and organizing the entities, their attributes and the entity to entity relationships, I took a screen shot of the home page of Medium.com.
		I then drew GREEN/BLUE rectangles over Entities and RED rectangles over attributes of those entities.</p>

		<!--Put Screenshot of home page here-->

		<h3>Entities</h3>
		<p>In my initial view, I found 2 main entities that grabbed my attention:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Articles</strong>(GREEN)- These are the main 'things' on the page that have to be saved to our database. Each article is an instance of the 'table' named Articles.</li>
			<li><strong>Authors</strong>/(BLUE)- These people can be categorized as an entity</li>

		</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Attributes</h3>
		<p>The attributes I've found describe characteristics on the Entities</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Titles of ARTICLE(RED)- These describe who wrote the article</li>
			<li>Date written of ARTICLE-The date the article was written is also put in our database.</li>
			<li>Name of AUTHOR- This is something we would want to save in a database. </li>

		</ul>
