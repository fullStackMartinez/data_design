# data_design
This is a personal project that builds a mini database using PHP and MySQL. I used Medium.com as my example to replicate. 

I started with identifying Entities and their Attributes(state variables) in order to build an Entity Relationship Diagram. I built a database of 3 tables using MySQL, then wrote OOP Classes for each Entity using PHP. 

You can find my sql code in the sql directory, and my php code/Classes in the php directory
