		<h1>What Makes a Good Female Lead?</h1>
		<p>When I watch a movie, I like to deconstruct the different characters that are involved in the plot. When it comes to female leads, I tend to enjoy seeing women that mirror the women in my life. For example, both my mom and girlfriend are strong, smart and independent. They have a certain confidence that they've built from overcoming challenges in this world. So when it comes to casting for a movie, I tend to like strong women that have a certain &quot;I can&quot; attitude, who overcome obstacles with grace. Those are the lead roles that make up a good and unique film. </p>
